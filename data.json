    "text": "I am a physicist specializing in quantum dynamics and open quantum\nsystems, with a strong background in numerical simulations, analytical calculations and delving with system-bath models. I am passionate about Mathematics and Physics in general. I am well prepared to teach undergraduate and postgraduate\ncourses in quantum mechanics, statistical physics, quantum computation and computational\nmethods. Passionate about integrating research with pedagogy and mentoring\nstudents in modern quantum science. Seeking a faculty position to\ncontribute to both high-quality research and curriculum innovation."

      "desc": "Polarons are key quasiparticles that govern the electronic and optical properties of organic semiconducting polymers and molecular aggregates. Understanding the dissipative dynamics of polarons in presence of a quantum bath of harmonic oscillators is crucial for elucidating how quantum systems evolve in realistic environments, with applications spanning quantum technologies, condensed matter physics, and chemical/biological systems.
