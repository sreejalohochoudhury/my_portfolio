    "text": "I am a physicist specializing in quantum dynamics and open quantum systems, with extensive experience in both numerical simulations and analytical methods, particularly within system–bath models. My research is driven by a deep passion for Mathematics and Physics, and I bring expertise in bridging theoretical insights with computational techniques.\n\nI am well prepared to teach undergraduate and postgraduate courses in quantum mechanics, statistical physics, quantum computation, and computational methods, with a strong commitment to integrating cutting-edge research into pedagogy. I value student mentoring, encouraging curiosity-driven learning, and guiding the next generation in modern quantum science.\n\nI am seeking a faculty position where I can contribute to both high-quality research and curriculum innovation.\n\nBeyond academia, I cultivate a balanced life through meditation, cooking, and the practice of martial arts (Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu), which strengthen focus, discipline, and creativity—qualities I also bring to my research and teaching."

      "desc": "Polarons are key quasiparticles that govern the electronic and optical properties of organic semiconducting polymers and molecular aggregates. Understanding the dissipative dynamics of polarons in presence of a quantum bath of harmonic oscillators is crucial for elucidating how quantum systems evolve in realistic environments, with applications spanning quantum technologies, condensed matter physics, and chemical/biological systems.
